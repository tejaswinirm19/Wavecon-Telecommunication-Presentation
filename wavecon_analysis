 Wavecon 5G Dashboard Analysis
About the Company
Wavecon is one of India’s leading telecom providers, delivering mobile, broadband, and enterprise services across the country. With innovation and customer experience at our core, we launched 5G to provide high-speed connectivity and unlock new revenue opportunities.
Agenda
Our analysis today covers:
1. Impact of 5G on revenue
2. Key KPIs and user trends
3. Plan-wise performance
4. Regional insights
5. Strategic recommendations
Understanding KPI’s
We focused on 4 key metrics:
• ARPU – measures how much revenue we earn per user
• TAU – shows our active user base
• TUsU – indicates churn risk
• MA – monthly averages for stability
1. ARPU – Average Revenue Per User
➤ What It Means:
The average amount of revenue earned from each active user in a given month.
➤ Formula:
ARPU = Total Revenue / Total Active Users (TAU)
➤ Why It Matters:
•	Measures revenue efficiency: are we monetizing users well?
•	Helps compare user value across time or plans.
•	If revenue grows but ARPU drops → growth may be driven by low-paying users.

2. TAU – Total Active Users
➤ What It Means:
Number of users who are currently using and paying for a Wavecon plan.
➤ Why It Matters:
•	Shows the size of your engaged, paying customer base.
•	High TAU = healthy business. Low TAU = risk of churn.
•	Used in calculating ARPU and identifying growth.

3. TUsU – Total Unsubscribed Users
➤ What It Means:
Number of users who cancelled their subscription or stopped using Wavecon plans.
➤ Why It Matters:
•	Indicates churn — which is a key risk metric.
•	High TUsU = loss of customers → revenue decline, brand concern.
•	Helps identify if 5G launch retained or lost users.

 4. MA – Monthly Average
➤ What It Means:
It usually refers to monthly average values of any KPI, such as:
•	Monthly average revenue
•	Monthly average active users
•	Monthly average churn
It helps smoothen out spikes and gives a better trend.

➤ Why It Matters:
•	Reduces noise in reporting.
•	Ideal for trend analysis (e.g., is ARPU rising monthly?)

Summary & Recommendations

• 5G launch = revenue and TAU growth
• Turbo & Prime are winning plans
• Base & Super Saver underperform
• ARPU is a concern

Recommendations:
1. Promote high-performing plans
2. Discontinue outdated plans
3. Improve ARPU via bundling, pricing
4. Focus on high-value cities
5. Use data-driven personalization
 1. Strengthen High-Performing 5G Plans (Turbo & Prime)
Why: These plans are your revenue leaders post-launch.
Strategy:
•	Double down on marketing campaigns for 5G Turbo and Prime.
•	Add value bundles (e.g., OTT subscriptions, extra data, VIP service).
•	Run “Refer & Earn” programs centered around these plans.
2. Retire Legacy & Underperforming Plans
Why: Plans like Base and Super Saver are dragging down KPIs like ARPU and user activity.
Strategy:
•	Officially discontinue these plans with a smooth migration path.
•	Offer limited-time upgrades to 5G for users on old plans.
•	Simplify offerings to reduce confusion and increase conversion.
 3. Improve ARPU with Tiered Upselling
Why: ARPU has not improved proportionally despite user growth.
Strategy:
•	Introduce mid-tier 5G plans with flexible add-ons.
•	Use AI-based usage analysis to recommend upgrades (smart pop-ups, alerts).
•	Offer loyalty-based tiered pricing (Silver/Gold/Platinum levels).

4. Leverage Real-Time User Behavior for Microtargeting
Why: Visuals show clear engagement patterns by plan.
Strategy:
•	Segment users by activity, data usage, and plan.
•	Target with custom campaigns: e.g., “Upgrade to 5G Turbo for 3 months at 20% off.”
•	Re-engage inactive users with win-back incentives.

 5. Educate Customers About 5G Value
Why: 5G adoption is strong but not universal — awareness is key.
Strategy:
•	Launch a “Why 5G” campaign across SMS, email, and app.
•	Simplify the benefits into 3 clear messages (speed, streaming, stability).
•	Use testimonials from high-usage users.

 6. Continuous KPI Monitoring Post-Launch
Why: Sustained success needs agile decision-making.
Strategy:
•	Set up monthly KPI review dashboards (ARPU, TAU, churn, plan-level revenue).
•	Use heatmaps to track high/low-performing plans by region.
•	Make real-time adjustments to pricing, offers, and user retention plans.

 Marketing & Campaign Strategy for 5G Success

1. Segment-Based Campaigns: Speak to Each User Type
Strategy: Use data from your dashboard to segment users into:

2. App-Based Personalized Campaigns
Strategy: Leverage the Wavecon app to deliver real-time, personalized offers.
•	In-app banners based on current plan:
“Your Super Saver Plan is now outdated – switch to 5G Turbo today.”
•	Push notifications triggered by usage thresholds:
“You're using 80% of your 4G plan – time for an upgrade?”

3. Partner Promotions & Bundled Benefits
Strategy: Bundle 5G plans with services users value.
•	OTT platforms: Netflix, Hotstar, etc.
•	Gaming packs for youth: “Zero-lag 5G Turbo + free games”
•	Work-from-home bundles: “5G + Zoom Pro + Extra Data”
This increases ARPU while giving users tangible benefits to switch.

4. Limited-Time Campaigns (Scarcity Drives Action)
Strategy: Run seasonal or FOMO-based campaigns.
•	“Switch to 5G in the next 7 days and get 1 month free”
•	“Early adopters get premium support for 3 months”
•	Flash discount weekends via SMS and app

 5. Customer Education = Higher Adoption
Strategy: Address the gap in understanding by running:
•	“Why 5G?” mini-webinars or short videos
•	SMS campaigns explaining benefits in 1 line:
“5G = 10x faster, same price.”
